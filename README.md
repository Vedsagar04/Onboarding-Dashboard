* How to Use
On first visit, the onboarding form will guide the user through three steps:

Personal info (name, email)

Business info (company, industry, size)

Preferences (theme and dashboard layout)

Validation errors appear in red if required fields are not filled.

Selecting theme and layout preferences controls the dashboard's appearance:

Light or Dark theme changes color scheme.

Grid or List layout changes how cards are displayed.

Dashboard fades in smoothly on load.

Cards have subtle hover animations.
